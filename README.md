# Celes-tial-Sketch

Celes-tial-Sketch is an application that takes user sketches and fits them optimally onto a projection of the night sky. Reshape the constellations as we know them, doodle all over the night sky or simply relax and listen to some sonorous music while staring into the stars. 

## Installation 

Clone the repository and run the file src/program.py through a python shell. May need to install the packages matplotlib, fetch and opencv-python.

# Celes-tial-Sketch

Celes-tial-Sketch is an application that takes user sketches and fits them optimally onto a projection of the night sky. Reshape the constellations as we know them, doodle all over the night sky or simply relax and listen to some sonorous music while staring into the stars. 

Celes-tial-Sketch was built as part of Citrus Hacks 2020 by Owen Bulka, Mitch Duffield and Toren Dofher.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the file src/program.py through a python shell. May need to install the packages matplotlib, fetch and opencv-python.

## Usage

After running the application a scrollable spherical star map will be projected around the user. Clicking the "Draw" button will bring up a canvas where the user can click to make a simple sketch. Clicking "Find Constellation" will send the sketch to the back end where an optimal match will be found with the existing star map. This will be projected for the user's viewing pleasure. Relax and enjoy the music.
